Certainly, you can respond to your company's question like this:

"While my experience at the Devoxx conference was quite positive, I believe one area for improvement could be to include more topics related to software performance testing. This would enhance the attendee experience by providing insights and strategies for optimizing software performance, which is a critical aspect of software development. Expanding the conference's focus in this direction would cater to a broader range of interests and needs within the software development community."
